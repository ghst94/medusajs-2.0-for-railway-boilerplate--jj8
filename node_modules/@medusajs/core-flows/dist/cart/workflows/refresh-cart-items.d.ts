 * This workflow refreshes a cart to ensure its prices, promotion codes, taxes, and other details are applied correctly. It's useful
 * after making a chnge to a cart, such as after adding an item to the cart or adding a promotion code.
 *
 * This workflow is used by other cart-related workflows, such as the {@link addToCartWorkflow} after an item
 * is added to the cart.
 *
 * You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to refresh the cart after making updates to it in your
 * custom flows.
 *
 * @example
 * const { result } = await refreshCartItemsWorkflow(container)
 * .run({
 *   input: {
 *     cart_id: "cart_123",
 *   }
 * })
 *
 * @summary
 *
 * Refresh a cart's details after an update.
 *
 * @property hooks.validate - This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.
